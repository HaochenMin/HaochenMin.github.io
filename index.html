                    A Terrarium in a jar, with drag and drop plants.  This project served as an introduction and refresher to HTML, CSS, and DOM elements.  
                    An initial layout of the terrarium and its plants were detailed through the index.html and formatted with CSS.
                    CSS allowed for targetting specific elements outlined in index.html, and the terrarium initially had its plants arranged through CSS refactoring
                    Javascript was then applied to the project, enabling a drag and drop placement for the plants, allowing for far greater and intuitive customization.

                    A time attack typing game using Sherlock quotes.  This project introduced event listeners to enable event-driven programming, and required much more logic than the Terrarium project.
                    Localstorage was used to store the player's scores, and I initially ran into difficulty making sure the scores shown was displayed properly due to the fact that a return value of null was
                    turned into a 'null' string, fixed by checking for both an inital null value if the there was no score that existed prior and for a 'null' string if the scores were already updated once.  
                    The scores from localstorage were mapped their respective leaderboard elements and updated accordingly if a new score beat a score on the top 5.

                    A typing game where you type the letter that appears at a random location on the screen that starts small but increases in size over time.  Building upon my experiences from the typing game,
                    Blast typing was an ambitious increase in new features to better understand and learn javascript scripting.  The textbox for player input was visually removed and now spanned the entire screen,
                    and divided into multiple sections to enable random location spawning of the incoming randomized letters.  The letters start small but increase over time while the potential points scored decreased over time.
                    An incorrect input returned a screenshake feedback and disabled player input as punishment during its duration.  A timeout was added for each letter that automatically progresses to the next letter while scoring
                    no points if the player did not input a letter in time.
