                    A time attack typing game using Sherlock quotes.  This project introduced event listeners to enable event-driven programming, and required much more logic than the Terrarium project.
                    Localstorage was used to store the player's scores, and I initially ran into difficulty making sure the scores shown was displayed properly due to the fact that a return value of null was
                    turned into a 'null' string, fixed by checking for both an inital null value if the there was no score that existed prior and for a 'null' string if the scores were already updated once.  
                    The scores from localstorage were mapped their respective leaderboard elements and updated accordingly if a new score beat a score on the top 5.
