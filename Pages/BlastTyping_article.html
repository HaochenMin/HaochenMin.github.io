                    A typing game where you type the letter that appears at a random location on the screen that starts small but increases in size over time.  Building upon my experiences from the typing game,
                    Blast typing was an ambitious increase in new features to better understand and learn javascript scripting.  The textbox for player input was visually removed and now spanned the entire screen,
                    and divided into multiple sections to enable random location spawning of the incoming randomized letters.  The letters start small but increase over time while the potential points scored decreased over time.
                    An incorrect input returned a screenshake feedback and disabled player input as punishment during its duration.  A timeout was added for each letter that automatically progresses to the next letter while scoring
                    no points if the player did not input a letter in time.
